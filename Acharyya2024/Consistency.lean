Status (2026-06-11): COMPLETE — no open obligations remain in this file.

- The probabilistic Trosset–Priebe raw-stress stability is proved in
  `Acharyya2024.RawStress`: deterministic core (minimizer existence, √-stress
  Lipschitz continuity, subsequence stability) + a modulus of continuity at the
  limit matrix + outer-measure event inclusion.  No measurable selection of
  minimizers is needed anywhere.
- Statements that were false as written in the original scaffold (missing
  probability hypotheses; an unconditional fixed-limit claim that fails when
  the limiting matrix admits minimizers with distinct distance profiles) have
  been REPAIRED: each now carries the honest hypotheses
  (`hsample`/`hlimit`/`huniq`) and is proved.  The repair history is recorded
  in planning/acharyya-plan.md and in git.

**Unconditional raw-stress MDS stability (set version).**

If the observed dissimilarity matrices converge in probability to `DeltaInf`,
then with probability tending to one, the random MDS output is `ε`-close in
every pairwise distance to *some* raw-stress minimizer of `DeltaInf`.  This is
the strongest statement that is true without further hypotheses: when
`DeltaInf` admits minimizers with genuinely different distance profiles, no
fixed limit configuration (and no subsequence) can serve all sample paths.

Proved in `Acharyya2024.RawStress.mds_stability_inProbability_set` via a
modulus of continuity at `DeltaInf` plus outer-measure event inclusion — no
measurable selection of minimizers is required.

Trosset-style raw-stress MDS stability — REPAIRED + PROVED (2026-06-11).

The original scaffold statement asserted a single subsequence and a fixed
`ψ ∈ MDS n d DeltaInf` with convergence in probability, with no hypothesis on
the minimizer set of `DeltaInf`.  That is not provable: if `DeltaInf` has two
minimizers with distinct pairwise-distance profiles and the sample output
oscillates between their neighborhoods with probability `1/2` each, no
subsequence converges in probability to a fixed profile.  The repaired
statement adds the profile-uniqueness hypothesis `huniq` the paper implicitly
needs, and in exchange concludes along the FULL sequence (the witness
subsequence is `id`) — strictly stronger than the paper's subsequence claim.

The unconditional content (closeness to the minimizer SET) is
`rawStress_mds_stability_set` above.

Convergence in probability to zero survives adding a deterministic vanishing
perturbation: if `0 ≤ C r ω ≤ A r ω + b r` with `A → 0` in probability and
`b → 0` deterministically, then `C → 0` in probability.

This is the triangle-inequality layer of the paper's Theorem 2: it splits the
empirical-to-limit error into the sampling error (handled by
`Acharyya2024.Probability`) and the deterministic Assumption-1 error.

Probability step for the fixed-model/growing-query regime (paper Theorem 2),
REPAIRED version.

The original scaffold statement had no hypotheses and was false. The honest
content splits as `frobSub (Dseq r ω) DeltaInf ≤
frobSub (Dseq r ω) (Delta r) + frobSub (Delta r) DeltaInf` where:

* `hsample` — the sampling error `frobSub (Dseq r ω) (Delta r)` converges to
  zero in probability; in the paper this is supplied by the Markov/variance
  argument, formalized in `Acharyya2024.Probability`
  (`dissimilarity_convergesInProbability_of_secondMoment`) together with
  `Acharyya2024.SecondMoment` (the iid `trace(Σ)/r` computation).
* `hlimit` — the deterministic Assumption-1 error
  `frobSub (Delta r) DeltaInf → 0`.

Triangular-array consistency for the growing-model regime — REPAIRED + PROVED
(2026-06-11, WP8).

The paper's final regime involves a triangular array of model sets and query
sets: at stage `k` there are `nOf k` models, and for each fixed `k` the sampled
dissimilarity matrices converge (in probability) to the stage-`k` limit
`DeltaInf k`.  The original scaffold statement had NO probability hypotheses
connecting `Dseq` to `DeltaInf` and was false as written; the repaired version
adds the per-stage hypotheses `hD` (dissimilarity convergence) and `huniq`
(profile uniqueness, as in `rawStress_mds_stability`).

The paper extracts one shared subsequence across all stages by a diagonal
argument.  Under the repaired layer-1 stability the diagonal argument is
unnecessary: the full sequence converges at every stage, so the shared
subsequence is simply `id` — a strictly stronger conclusion.

SCOPE CAVEAT (honesty).  This is the *per-stage, finite* form: a countable family
of finite (`Fin (nOf k)`) consistency statements, one per stage `k`.  It is NOT
the paper's full Theorem 4/5 conclusion, which is an `Lᵖ` average over a
*continuum* of iid model draws `φ ~ P` from the model space —
`∫∫ |‖ψ̂₁ − ψ̂₂‖ − ‖mds(φ₁) − mds(φ₂)‖|ᵖ dP dP →P 0`.  Modelling the model
distribution `P`, the iid draw of models, and the continuous-MDS map `mds(φ)` is
not formalized here; this theorem is the finite consistency content that the
paper's argument specializes to at each stage, re-indexed over stages.
