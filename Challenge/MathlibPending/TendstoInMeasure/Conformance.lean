# TendstoInMeasure from a vanishing rate (pending: verify substantive)

`Conformance.lean` imports only Mathlib and states the leaf theorem(s) as open obligations;
`Leaderboard.lean` imports the project and supplies the proofs. Only the leaf
(top-level) theorems are listed -- `#print axioms` on a leaf transitively certifies its
whole proof tree.
