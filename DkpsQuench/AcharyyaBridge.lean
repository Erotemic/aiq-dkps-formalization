Deterministic bridges from finite Acharyya DKPS concentration statements to the
Quench query-efficiency concentration hypothesis.

Quench's theorem is stated over an abstract model space and assumes a uniform
embedding-error event over all models.  Acharyya's DKPS concentration theorems
are finite-configuration statements.  The bridge therefore explicitly assumes a
factorization of the Quench embedding maps through a finite Acharyya
configuration.

/--
Finite Acharyya configuration concentration gives Quench's uniform model-space
embedding concentration when the true and estimated Quench embeddings factor
through the finite configuration by an index map.

The factorization hypothesis is essential: without it, a bound over `Fin n`
cannot imply a bound over an arbitrary model type.
