# Graph subspaces and angular operators

Literature writeup: local TeX, Sections 16--17.  This is the geometric bridge
between projection estimates and operator Riccati equations.
-/


/-! ## Construction plan

* Define the graph subspace as the range of `x |-> (x, X x)` under the
  orthogonal-sum equivalence; for an ambient decomposition, transport this
  construction through `U x Uperp ~= E`.
* Prove the graph projection formula by solving the normal equations.  The
  diagonal factors are `(1+X⋆X)^{-1}` and `(1+XX⋆)^{-1}` and are positive
  invertible.
* Derive the graph/angular correspondence from transversality of the first
  coordinate projection, then identify the graph norm with tangent of the
  operator angle.

/-- Every acute subspace is the graph of a unique bounded angular operator.

Proof strategy:

* regard `P_U|_V : V -> U` as a bounded map between Banach spaces;
* prove it is bijective from the acute/equal-defect hypotheses;
* invoke the bounded inverse theorem;
* set `X u = P_{Uᗮ} ((P_U|_V)⁻¹ u)` and extend it by zero on `Uᗮ`;
* prove the graph equality by decomposing each `v ∈ V` into its `U` and
  `Uᗮ` components;
* prove uniqueness by applying `P_U` and `P_{Uᗮ}` to an arbitrary graph
  representation.

The finite-dimensional theorem should later be a specialization of this
result, not an independent basis calculation. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Obtain an angular operator from `acute_iff_exists_bounded_angularOperator`.
2. Show its range description agrees with `graphSubspace` by unfolding the latter.
3. For uniqueness, apply `P_U` and `P_{Uᗮ}` to equal graph vectors and use injectivity of the graph parametrization.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct. Acuteness supplies both injectivity
and surjectivity of the coordinate projection and therefore uniqueness of the bounded
graph map.

Preferred dependency route: Build on the acute graph representation and the bounded
inverse theorem, then use functional calculus for `I + X*X` to obtain projection and
angle formulas.

/-- Projection onto a graph subspace in terms of the angular operator.

Proof strategy: define the isometry from `U` into the graph by normalizing
`u ↦ u + X u` with `(I + X*X)^{-1/2}`.  The graph projection is `J J*`.
Expand this product in the decomposition `U ⊕ Uᗮ`, commute the functional
calculus terms through `X` using the polar decomposition, and identify the
four blocks with `graphProjectionFormula`.  Prove positivity and invertibility
of `I + X*X` before performing block algebra. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Define the normalized graph embedding `J u=(u,Xu)(I+X*X)^{-1/2}`.
2. Prove `J` is an isometry onto `graphSubspace U X`.
3. Compute the orthogonal projection as `J J*` and expand its four blocks.
4. Match the expanded expression with `graphProjectionFormula U X`.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct only with `IsAngularOperator`; without
that hypothesis the ambient map may mix the base and complementary coordinates and the
advertised block formula is false.

Preferred dependency route: Build on the acute graph representation and the bounded
inverse theorem, then use functional calculus for `I + X*X` to obtain projection and
angle formulas.

/-- Tangent of the maximal angle is the angular-operator norm. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Use `projection_graphSubspace_formula` to compute the gap between `U` and the graph.
2. Show the gap is `‖X‖/sqrt(1+‖X‖²)` by functional calculus and spectral mapping.
3. Apply the scalar identity `tan(arcsin(x/sqrt(1+x²)))=x` for `x≥0`.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct because every bounded graph is acute.
The proof must establish the angle range before applying inverse trigonometric
identities.

Preferred dependency route: Build on the acute graph representation and the bounded
inverse theorem, then use functional calculus for `I + X*X` to obtain projection and
angle formulas.

/-- Contractive angular operators correspond to angles below `π / 4`. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Rewrite the angle with `tan_maximalAngle_eq_norm_angularOperator`.
2. Establish `0≤maximalAngle<π/2` for a graph subspace.
3. Use strict monotonicity of `tan` and `tan(π/4)=1` to prove both implications.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct after the preceding tangent identity
and the fact that graph angles lie in `[0,π/2)`.

Preferred dependency route: Build on the acute graph representation and the bounded
inverse theorem, then use functional calculus for `I + X*X` to obtain projection and
angle formulas.
