/-- Residual `sin Θ` theorem for an isometric trial map. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Set `Y=(I-P_U)X` and derive `A|_{Uᗮ} Y - Y M = (I-P_U) residual A X M`.
2. Apply the ordered constant-one Sylvester theorem using `hsep`.
3. Bound the projected residual by the full residual norm.
4. Identify `Y` with `sinThetaEmbedding U X`.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct as a directed residual theorem. The
isometric embedding is needed for the subspace interpretation, although the raw
Sylvester norm estimate itself uses only boundedness.

Preferred dependency route: Derive the cross-block Sylvester equation and specialize the
strongest available Sylvester theorem; only then translate cross-block norms into
directed or full subspace angles.

/-- One-sided perturbation theorem for spectral subspaces. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Derive the off-diagonal Sylvester equation for `X=(I-P_V)P_U`.
2. Use the interval/exterior decomposition to apply the constant-one ordered Sylvester estimate to the lower and upper pieces.
3. Bound the right-hand residual by `‖B-A‖`.
4. Rewrite `‖X‖` as the directed gap.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct as a one-sided directed-angle theorem.
One mixed interval/exterior gap is intentionally insufficient for a full
projector-difference conclusion.

Preferred dependency route: Derive the cross-block Sylvester equation and specialize the
strongest available Sylvester theorem; only then translate cross-block norms into
directed or full subspace angles.

/-- **The dimension-free operator-norm Davis--Kahan `sin Θ` theorem, coercivity
form.**  For self-adjoint `A, B` on an arbitrary Hilbert space, `U` reducing `A`
with quadratic form `≥ (c+g)‖·‖²` on `U`, and `V` reducing `B` with quadratic
form `≤ c‖·‖²` on `V`,

`‖P_V P_U‖ ≤ ‖B − A‖ / g`.

This is the genuine infinite-dimensional `sin Θ` bound: the analytic core is the
integral-free Sylvester estimate `norm_sylvester_le_of_coercive` (no spectral
measure, no dimension or completeness hypothesis on the *bound* itself), and the
block construction `A ∘L P + (c+g)(1−P)`, `B ∘L Q + c(1−Q)` uses only the
dimension-free projection commutation `projection_apply_comm_of_reduces`.  The
spectrum-predicate forms (`sinTheta_perturbation`, `IntervalExteriorSeparated`)
follow from this once a bounded spectral theorem converts spectral separation to
these coercivity bounds. -/

/-- Symmetric projector-difference form requiring both mixed gaps. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Apply `sinTheta_perturbation` to `(U,V)` and again to `(V,U)` using the reverse gap.
2. Use the two-projection norm identity that the full gap is the maximum of the two directed gaps.
3. Combine the two inequalities with `max_le` and simplify the perturbation sign.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct with both mixed gaps. The full
projection gap is the maximum of the two directed gaps in operator norm.

Preferred dependency route: Derive the cross-block Sylvester equation and specialize the
strongest available Sylvester theorem; only then translate cross-block norms into
directed or full subspace angles.

/-- General separated-spectrum form with the optimal universal `π / 2`
Sylvester constant. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

2. Apply `norm_sylvester_le_of_generalSeparation` with the hybrid spectral gap.
3. Bound the residual block by `‖B-A‖` using projection contractions.

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

3. Rewrite the subspace gap as the norm of the two spectral projections.

/-- Symmetric-ideal form. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Decompose the full sine operator into the two directed off-diagonal blocks.
2. Apply the interval/exterior ideal-valued Sylvester estimate to each block, using `hmem` for the perturbation.
3. Recombine the blocks through the two-projection decomposition or the symmetric-angle identity.
4. Return both ideal membership and the gauge inequality.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Plausible with the full ambient sine
convention because the self-adjoint off-diagonal blocks occur as adjoint pairs. The
proof must establish the corresponding ideal block identity; do not combine two directed
estimates by a triangle inequality, which would lose the sharp constant.

strongest available Sylvester theorem; only then translate cross-block norms into
directed or full subspace angles.
