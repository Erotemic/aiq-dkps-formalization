# Spectral projection continuation and branch selection

Literature writeup: local TeX, Sections 15 and 20--24.  The infinite-
dimensional tangent theorems require selecting the perturbed spectral
component by a norm-continuous path of Riesz projections.

/-- Norm continuity of the selected projection path.

Proof strategy: fix a contour that remains uniformly inside the resolvent set.
Use the second resolvent identity to prove uniform norm continuity of
`z ↦ (z-A_t)⁻¹` in the path parameter, dominate the contour integrand by the
inverse distance to the spectrum, and pass continuity through the contour
Bochner integral.  Derive an explicit Lipschitz estimate when the contour
margin is quantitative. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Unfold `continuedProjection` and `operatorPath` and reuse the local resolvent estimates from `continuous_rieszProjection_path`.
2. At each `t∈[0,1]`, obtain a neighborhood on which the fixed contour remains in the resolvent set; this suffices for `ContinuousWithinAt`.
3. Pass the local resolvent continuity through the contour integral and assemble the pointwise statements into `ContinuousOn`.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): The corrected `ContinuousOn [0,1]` signature
asks only for separation on the path segment actually used. A global continuity theorem
remains available in the resolvent module.

Preferred dependency route: Use a uniformly separating Riesz contour on `[0,1]`,
norm-continuity of resolvents, and local equivalences of close projection ranges.

/-- The continued projection remains in the component selected at `t = 0`. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Use the supplied continued projection path restricted to `[0,1]` as the witness.
2. Reuse `hcontinuous` for path continuity and `hproj` for projection-valuedness.
3. Normalize the endpoints with `rfl`; no spectral argument is needed in this lemma.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct after `SameProjectionComponent` was
localized to continuity on `[0,1]`; global continuity would be unnecessary
overstrengthening.

Preferred dependency route: Use a uniformly separating Riesz contour on `[0,1]`,
norm-continuity of resolvents, and local equivalences of close projection ranges.

/-- Continued Riesz projections select the spectral component born from the
initial component. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Use `rieszProjection_eq_spectralProjection` at `t=1`, passing `hs`.
2. Verify that `operatorPath A H 1 = A+H` by `simp [operatorPath]`.
3. Specialize the uniformly separating-contour hypothesis at `1 ∈ [0,1]`.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct with the explicit measurability
premise if the fixed contour encloses the same Borel spectral component throughout the
path. At `t=1`, self-adjointness follows from `hA` and `hH`.

Preferred dependency route: Use a uniformly separating Riesz contour on `[0,1]`,
norm-continuity of resolvents, and local equivalences of close projection ranges.

/-- Norm-close projections have canonically isomorphic ranges; this is the
local step used to propagate dimension and Fredholm-index data along a path.

Proof strategy: for projections `P,Q` with `‖P-Q‖<1`, show `Q|Ran(P)` is
bounded below and `P|Ran(Q)` is its inverse up to the invertible positive
operators `PQP` and `QPQ`.  Construct the canonical range equivalence using
the polar factor of `QP`, or equivalently `(PQP)^{-1/2}`.  This lemma replaces
finite rank counting in the infinite branch-selection proof. 

Lean proof route for a weaker agent:

1. Prove `Q` restricted to `Ran P` is bounded below by `1-‖P-Q‖`.
2. Show its range is closed and its orthogonal complement is trivial, hence it is bijective onto `Ran Q`.
3. Take the polar factor of `QP` to obtain a unitary between the ranges and extend it over complements.
4. Verify the global intertwining equation.


Ext-agent signature audit (GPT 5.6 High): Correct. Close orthogonal projections have
unitarily equivalent ranges and complements; the global unitary intertwiner is stronger
than a mere range isomorphism but standard.

Preferred dependency route: Use a uniformly separating Riesz contour on `[0,1]`,
norm-continuity of resolvents, and local equivalences of close projection ranges.
