# Sylvester equations under spectral separation

This file scaffolds the rectangular, every-unitarily-invariant-norm Sylvester
machinery implicit in the Davis--Kahan proofs.

Literature map:

* `ForMathlib/prose/Davis-Kahan-1970-part-III-core-arguments.tex`,
  Section 6.
* Davis--Kahan (1970), Section 5, "On the equation `AX-XB=C`".
* The ordered/coercive special case already proved in
  `ForMathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/SylvesterBound.lean`.

The interval/exterior theorem has sharp constant one.  The final theorem in
this file records the separate `π/2`-constant extension for arbitrary disjoint
spectral sets; it must not be used silently in the classic constant-one API.
-/


/-! ## Remaining construction plan

The Sylvester map itself is now explicit.  Next diagonalize the two symmetric
endpoint operators, identify its matrix entries with multiplication by
`lambda_i-mu_j`, and use spectral separation to prove injectivity and construct
the inverse.  Prove the interval/exterior constant-one estimate through the
ordered divided-difference multiplier.  Treat arbitrary separated spectra in a
separate theorem with the `pi/2` constant and then derive residual results by
applying the rectangular norm ideal property.

/-! ## Weak-agent execution plan: finite Sylvester inversion and sharp bounds

### A. Repair the total solution definition without adding hypotheses

`solveSylvester A B C` is intentionally total, while invertibility is only
known under a gap.  Define it by a decidable branch on bijectivity:

* if `h : Function.Bijective (sylvesterOperator A B)`, use
  `(LinearEquiv.ofBijective _ h).symm C`;
* otherwise return `0`.

Add a private lemma saying the definition reduces to that inverse under a
supplied bijectivity proof.  In `sylvesterOperator_solveSylvester`, derive
injectivity from the gap, obtain surjectivity with
`LinearMap.injective_iff_surjective`, enter the positive branch, and use
`LinearEquiv.apply_symm_apply`.  This is cleaner than choosing eigenbases in
the definition and confines coordinates to the injectivity proof.

### B. Direct injectivity proof

Use eigenbases `eA` and `eB` for the symmetric maps.  For `Y` in the kernel,
apply the equation to `eB j` and take inner product with `eA i`.  After rewriting
both eigenvector equations, obtain

`(α i - β j) * ⟪eA i, Y (eB j)⟫ = 0`.

Turn `SpectraSeparated ... δ` and `0 < δ` into `α i - β j ≠ 0`; then every
matrix coefficient vanishes.  Prove `Y (eB j) = 0` by the orthonormal-basis
extensionality theorem and finally prove `Y = 0` by `LinearMap.ext` plus basis
induction/expansion.  Introduce named helpers for “eigenvalue belongs to the
restricted spectrum” and “separation implies denominator nonzero” so the main
proof is not dominated by set-membership coercions.

### C. Ordered form bounds: generalize the existing absorption proof

Do not diagonalize for `uiNorm_sylvester_le_of_form_bounds`.  The file
`SylvesterBound.lean` already proves an abstract seminorm absorption theorem
for square continuous maps.  Extract or copy that theorem with three spaces:

* left endomorphism on `F`;
* right endomorphism on `E`;
* rectangular unknown `E →L[𝕜] F`.

Its assumptions are exactly additivity, absolute homogeneity, and left/right
ideal inequalities.  Instantiate those with the rectangular UI norm after
converting finite linear maps to continuous linear maps.  The same midpoint
shift proves the separated form with constant one.  This route is both shorter
and more robust than an eigenvalue Schur-multiplier proof.

### D. Interval/exterior gap

First construct the lower and upper spectral subspaces of `A` relative to
`a-δ` and `b+δ`.  Decompose the codomain into these reducing blocks and write
`X = Xlo + Xhi` by postcomposition with the two projections.  Each block
satisfies an ordered Sylvester equation, so apply the constant-one theorem to
both.  To recombine without losing a factor two, prove the pinching/Ky-Fan
lemma for orthogonal codomain blocks before proving this theorem.  The natural
root theorem is `kyFan_sylvester_le_of_intervalGap`; derive the arbitrary
`N` result from rectangular Fan dominance rather than proving it separately.

### E. Arbitrary disjoint spectra

Keep `uiNorm_sylvester_le_of_spectralDistance` independent.  The absorption
argument does not prove the `π/2` theorem.  Preferred finite route:

1. diagonalize both endpoints;
2. represent the inverse as the Schur multiplier
   `m i j = 1 / (α i - β j)`;
3. prove the Bhatia--Davis--McIntosh multiplier bound on every Ky Fan norm;
4. invoke rectangular Fan dominance.

Do not let this theorem block the interval/exterior Davis--Kahan chain.

### F. Coercion discipline

Perform algebra in `LinearMap` until the final norm estimate.  When invoking
`SylvesterBound`, create named continuous maps and prove the equation with
`ContinuousLinearMap.ext`; do not repeatedly unfold `toContinuousLinearMap`.
After any composition rewrite, normalize with `LinearMap.comp_apply` or
`ContinuousLinearMap.comp_apply` before using eigenvector equations.

/-- The Sylvester operator is injective under positive spectral separation.

The proof is coordinate-free at the API boundary but uses the canonical
self-adjoint eigenbases internally.  Testing `A X - X B = 0` against an
`A`-eigenvector after evaluating at a `B`-eigenvector gives
`(α - β) * ⟪X eβ, eα⟫ = 0`; separation makes the scalar factor nonzero, and
two basis-extensionality steps force `X = 0`.

Injectivity above implies surjectivity because the Sylvester operator is an

the `apply_symm_apply` identity of the linear equivalence built from that
bijection; no second coordinate calculation is needed.
